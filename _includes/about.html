                <h2>About Margaret</h2>
                <p>Growing up in the former Soviet Union, Margaret was inspired by
                    the hard work of her parents and surrounding family to produce
                    the best quality work. Academically inclined from a young age,
                    Margaret subsequently fell in love with logic games and puzzles
                    and decidedly pursued a PhD in mathematics. Upon arriving to
                    the United States, she saw the opportunity to apply her love of
                    mathematics by helping people find their right home.</p>
                <p>Licensed for 26 years, Margaret has sold hundreds of properties
                    in Virginia and DC. Primarily active in Northern Virginia,
                    where she resides with her loving husband Lev, she has experienced
                    the market in its highs and lows. For inquiries on
